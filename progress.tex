\section{Overview}

This is a progress report for a Computer Science Honours project related to mesh reconstructions from CT image stacks. I will recap the most relevant content of my project proposal and literature survey, and describe my progress in investigating improvements on prior methods. I will also take this opportunity to discuss techniques yet to be investigated and my rationale for them. Finally I will outline my goals and schedule for the remainder of the year.
